4 => 3 + GENERATE PATHS WITH URLPath INSTEAD OF HARD CODING

3 => 2 + GET PATH DATA FROM URLPath INSTEAD OF FROM $self->r

1 => REMOVE DEPENDANCY ON DATA FROM @_ (get from URLPath instead)
(this has to be done before things will work.)
	
	
	


0 => NONE OF THE ABOVE DONE

----- Code that needs cleaning -----

- lots of code needs to be factored out of Problem and GatewayQuiz:
	- problem logic (recording answers, checking permissions, etc.)
	- display idioms (attemptResults, etc.)
- Hardcopy:
	- move actual PDF generation into a Utils::* module
	- clean up error handling
- code can be factored out of Grades, Stats, and SendMail
	- a widget for displaying the "student progress" chart
	- util code for doing mail merge from scoring files (whatever it does)
- Instructor needs work -- there's a lot of cut-n-paste going on
- factor info box formatting code out of Login, ProblemSets, ProblemSet
  and into WeBWorK::HTML::InfoBox
- some modules should probably go under Utils:
	- Compatability.pm
	- Timing.pm
