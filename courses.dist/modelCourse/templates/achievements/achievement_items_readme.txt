To use achievement items you should import the default_achievement_items.axp
achievements using the editor.  

If you want to change which items are given at which levels you need to do two 
things.  
1) You should change the line 
$globalData->{SuperExtendDueDate} = 1;
to have a different achievement item id. 
2) Using the editor, you should change the name of the achievement in the 
description of the level.
