This set of $WW problems is designed to orient you to the $WW system
and to help you learn how to communicate with the software. You will
be learning about how to understand what you see on the screen and
about how to enter your answers when you do the problems.  You will
practice entering numerical and functional expressions and look at
ways to find and correct errors in your entries.
$PAR

Start by examining the features of this page.  The panels at the
left and top help you to navigate to the different pages available in
WeBWorK.
$PAR
On the left, in the ${LQ}Main Menu${RQ} panel, you have already 
seen the ${LQ}Homework Sets${RQ} page,
which lists all the homework assignments (with due dates, etc.) that have
been assigned to you.  Links allow you to go to any assignment
you want to work on.  
$PAR
The ${LQ}Password/Email${RQ} page lets you change your password or
email address.  The ${LQ}Grades${RQ} page 
shows your scores on the various assignments (but there is nothing
much to show at this point).
$PAR

Links to your homework assignments are also listed in the ${LQ}Sets${RQ} 
panel so you can quickly switch to another assignment.
$PAR

The ${LQ}Display Options${RQ} panel gives you control over how you want
math equations displayed.  For example with ${LQ}MathJax${RQ} you can 
control the size of equations, have access to accessibility options, etc.
$PAR

\{
#The ${LQ}Report Bugs${RQ} button is for reporting bugs in the WeBWorK
#System itself to the developers WeBWorK.  It is unlikely that
#you will need to use that yourself.  If you are having difficulty with
#WeBWorK, you should contact your professor using the ${LQ}Email
#Instructor${RQ} button instead.  This should be available on nearly
#every page, so you always have a quick way to reach your professor.
#$PAR
\}

The data in the panel at the top of the page tells you where you
are in WeBWorK's hierarchy of pages, but you can ignore that for the
most part.  There is an additional logout button at the far right,
however, that you will need to use when you are done using $WW (don't
press it yet).
$PAR

\{
#The yellow question mark icon is a ${LQ}Help${RQ}
#button for system documentation, but there is not much of that
#available at the moment.
#$PAR
\}

The main information on this page is located in the large panel
to the left.  It shows the status of the problems in this assignment,
and your score on the set so far.  Since you haven't yet tried any of
the problems, your score is zero, but after you work on some of them,
the number of attempts and the score will reflect the work you have
done.
$PAR
Near the top is a link that allows you to download a pdf ${LQ}hardcopy${RQ}
version of your 
whole assignment which you can print out.  This allows you to work on 
the assignment without having to be connected to $WW.
$PAR
Each problem number is a link to that problem in the homework set.
You can click on one to get to any specific problem.  To begin the
orientation assignment, click on the link for Problem 1.  When you are
done working, be sure to dismiss your connection to the server by
clicking on ${LQ}Log Out${RQ}, so that no one else can gain access to
your account.
