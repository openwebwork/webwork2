$PAR

This set of $WW problems is designed to orient you to the $WW system
and to help you learn how to communicate with the software. You will
be learning about how to understand what you see on the screen and
about how to enter your answers when you do the problems.  You will
practice entering numerical and functional expressions and look at
ways to find and correct errors in your entries.

Start by examining the features of this page.  The panels at the
left (the ${LQ}MAIN MENU${RQ}) and top help you to navigate to the different 
pages available in WeBWorK.  Note you can collapse and
uncollapse the ${LQ}MAIN MENU${RQ} by clicking on the boxed angle bracket just above the boldface course name so if you don't see the MAIN MENU click 
on the boxed angle bracket to make MAIN MENU reappear.

$PAR
On the left, in the ${LQ}MAIN MENU${RQ} panel, you have already 
seen the ${LQ}Homework Sets${RQ} page,
which lists all the homework assignments that have
been assigned to you.  Links allow you to go to any assignment
you want to work on.  
$PAR
The ${LQ}User Settings${RQ} page lets you change your password,
email address and display options. Display Options gives you control 
over how you want math equations displayed.  For example with 
${LQ}MathJax${RQ} you can control the size of equations, have access to accessibility options, etc.  The ${LQ}Grades${RQ} page 
shows your scores on the various assignments (but there is nothing
much to show at this point).
$PAR

Links to your homework assignments are also listed in the ${LQ}Sets${RQ} 
panel so you can quickly switch to another assignment.
$PAR

\{
#The ${LQ}Report Bugs${RQ} button is for reporting bugs in the WeBWorK
#System itself to the developers WeBWorK.  It is unlikely that
#you will need to use that yourself.  If you are having difficulty with
#WeBWorK, you should contact your professor using the ${LQ}Email
#Instructor${RQ} button instead.  This should be available on nearly
#every page, so you always have a quick way to reach your professor.
#$PAR
\}

The data in the panel at the top of the page tells you where you
are in WeBWorK's hierarchy of pages, but you can ignore that for the
most part.  There is an additional logout button at the far right,
however, that you will need to use when you are done using $WW (don't
press it yet).  Also to the left is the boxed angle bracket that
collapses and uncollapses the ${LQ}MAIN MENU${RQ}.
$PAR

\{
#The yellow question mark icon is a ${LQ}Help${RQ}
#button for system documentation, but there is not much of that
#available at the moment.
#$PAR
\}

The main information on this page is located in the large panel
to the left.  It shows the status of the problems in this assignment,
and your score on the set so far.  Since you haven't yet tried any of
the problems, your score is zero, but after you work on some of them,
the number of attempts and the score will reflect the work you have
done.
$PAR
Near the bottom is a link that allows you to download a pdf ${LQ}hardcopy${RQ}
version of your 
whole assignment which you can print out.  This allows you to work on 
the assignment without having to be connected to $WW.
$PAR
Also near the bottom of this and every $WW page there is an 
${LQ}Email instructor${RQ} link that you can use to send email to your instructor.  That email, in addition to what ever you write, will 
contain information on whatever page you are on so, e.g. if you are 
working on a problem, your instructor will know what problem it is.

$PAR
Each problem number is a link to that problem in the homework set.
You can click on one to get to any specific problem.  To begin the
orientation assignment, click on the link for Problem 1.  When you are
done working, be sure to dismiss your connection to the server by
clicking on ${LQ}Log Out${RQ}, so that no one else can gain access to
your account.
