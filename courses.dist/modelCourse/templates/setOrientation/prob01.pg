Title("Understanding $WW Problem Pages");

##############################################
BEGIN_TEXT

The $WW screen is divided into several areas, each used for a
different purpose.  You will need to understand these
in order to use $WW effectively.
$PAR

At the upper left are the navigation buttons that allow you to move
from problem to problem.  The ${LQ}Next$RQ and ${LQ}Previous$RQ
buttons, naturally, send you to the next and previous problems.  The
${LQ}Prob. List$RQ button takes you back to the opening
page for the homework set (the one that lists all the problems and
gives the instructions for the homework set).
$PAR

The area below the navigation buttons is where $WW tells you about
your score for the current problem.  When you have submitted your
answers, this is where you will be given information about what
answers you got right and wrong.  (It will be shown on a grey
backgound to help make it stand out; you will see this later.) This
area also shows you how many points a problem is worth.
$PAR

The main part of the page is the text of the problem you are trying to
answer, including blank boxes for you to enter your answers. (There 
aren't any such boxes on this page, because you are not being asked
any questions here, but usually there will be one or more answer blanks
on a page.)
$PAR

Below the problem text is a message area where you may be informed
about how partial credit is handled in multi-part problems.  Other
information also may appear there, such as a message indicating that
the due date is passed, or that answers are available.
$PAR

In the red panel at the left, instead of the list of homework sets, you
now have a list of the problems within this assignment.  You can go to
any problem just by clicking on it.  The checkboxes at the bottom of
the panel are discussed in the next problem.
$PAR

In the center of the top red panel is an indication of how much time
you have left to work on the problems for this set.  Note that this is
computed at the moment you downloaded the problem page; if you use the
${LQ}Back$RQ and ${LQ}Forward$RQ buttons on your browser, this does
not reload the page, so the times will not be updated.  Reload the
page using your browser's Reload or Refresh buttons to get the current
time.
$PAR

The buttons at the bottom of the screen, including the ${LQ}Submit
Answers$RQ button, are discussed in the next problem. At this point,
you can get credit for Problem 1 by pressing the ${LQ}Submit
Answers$RQ button at the bottom of the page (even though there was no
answer to submit), and then pressing the ${LQ}Next$RQ button at the
top of the screen to go on to the next problem.
