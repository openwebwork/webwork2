BEGIN_TEXT

Many of the answers you enter into $WW will be expressions
that involve variables.  Here are some important things to know.

$PAR

\{BeginParList("UL")\}

$ITEM
It matters what letter you use.  For example, if you are asked for a
function using the variable \(x\), then it won't work to enter the
function with the variable \(t\). Also, $WW considers upper- and
lower-case letters to be different, so don't use the capital letter
\{student "X"\} in place of the lower-case letter \{student "x"\}. 
The following blank is expecting the
function \(x^3\), which you would enter as \{student "x${CARET}3"\} or
\{student "x**3"\}.  Instead, try entering \{student "t${CARET}3"\} and
submitting your answer.

$PAR
$BBLOCKQUOTE
\{ans_rule(10)\}
$EBLOCKQUOTE
$PAR

You should get an error message informing you that \{computer "t"\}
is not defined in this context.  This tells you that $WW did not receive the
correct variable and doesn't know how to check your answer.  Now enter
\{student "x${CARET}3"\} and resubmit to get credit for this part of
the problem.

END_TEXT

ANS(Formula("x^3")->cmp);

$IMGA = MathIMG("prob05-a.gif","1/x+1","1/x+1");
$IMGB = MathIMG("prob05-b.gif","1/(x+1)","\frac{1}{x+1}");
$IMGC = MathIMG("prob05-c.gif","(1/x)+1","\frac{1}{x} + 1");

BEGIN_TEXT

$ITEM
$WW requires that you be precise in how you think about and present
your answer.  We have just seen that you need to be careful about the
variables that you use.  You must be equally careful about how the
rules of precedence apply to your answers.  Often, this involves using
parentheses appropriately.

$PAR

For example, you might write $IMGA on your paper when you meant $IMGB,
but that is actually incorrect.  The expression $IMGA means $IMGC,
according to the rules of precedence.  $WW will force you to be exact
in what you are thinking and in what you are writing, because it must
interpret your answers according to the standard rules.  If you want
to enter something that means $IMGB, you must write \{student
"1/(x+1)"\}.  This also is true in written work, so making a habit of
being precise about this will improve your written mathematics as well
as your ability to enter answers quickly and correctly in $WW.
