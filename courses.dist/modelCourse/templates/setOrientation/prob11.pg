You may sometimes be asked to provide more than one answer in a single
answer blank.  For example, you may need to enter all the values where
a function is not defined.  In this case, you should separate your
answers by commas.  Such an answer is called a
${BITALIC}list${EITALIC} in $WW.  Note that you need not enter
multiple answers for a list; a single number is a legal answer (there
might only be one point where the function is undefined, for
instance).

The function \(\displaystyle f(x)=$f\) is not defined at these \(x\) values: \{ans_rule(20)\}.

When you are asked for a list of numbers, another possible answer is
that there are ${BITALIC}no${EITALIC} numbers that satisfy the
requirements.  In that case, you should enter ${LQ}\{student
"NONE"\}${RQ} as your answer.
