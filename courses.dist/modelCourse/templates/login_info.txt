This file should explain to users how they can find their username and
initial password. It might also tell users what they should do after
logging in for the first time. It might also explain about guest login
access, if you enable that.

Do not modify the version of this file in
webwork2/courses.dist/modelCourse/templates/

Instead, we recommend you edit the version of this file in
courses/modelCourse/templates/
as soon as the modelCourse is created, when WeBWorK is first installed.
Your modified version will then propagate into new courses.

Of course a version of this file in a course's templates/ folder can
also be customized for that course.

In any case, if the login_info.txt file eexactly matches the version in
webwork2/courses.dist/modelCourse/templates/
then this content will not be displayed to users.

This file is used as a snippet of HTML, so you may use HTML markup.
For example, you might delete all of this explanation, and keep the
following:

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;">
Welcome to WeBWorK!
</p>

Your username is your email prefix and your initial password is your
student ID number. Please change your password to something secure by
visiting User Settings after logging in.
