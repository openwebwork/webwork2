# This file is used to override the global WeBWorK course environment for
# requests to this course. All package variables set in this file are added to
# the course environment. If you wish to set a variable here but omit it from
# the course environment,  use the "my" keyword. Commonly changed configuration
# options are noted below.

# Database Layout (global value typically defined in global.conf)
# 
# Several database are defined in the file conf/database.conf and stored in the
# hash %dbLayouts.
# 
# The database layout is always set here, since one should be able to change the
# default value in global.conf without disrupting existing courses.
# 
# global.conf values:
# 	$dbLayoutName = 'sql_single';
# 	*dbLayout = $dbLayouts{$dbLayoutName};

$dbLayoutName = 'sql_single';
*dbLayout = $dbLayouts{$dbLayoutName};

# Allowed Mail Recipients (global value typically not defined)
#
# Defines addresses to which the PG system is allowed to send mail. This should
# probably be set to the addresses of professors of this course. Sending mail
# from the PG system (i.e. questionaires, essay questions) will fail if this is
# not set.
#
# $mail{allowedRecipients} = ['email@address.here'];


# Feedback Mail Recipients (global value typically not defined)
#
# Defines recipients for feedback mail. If not defined, mail is sent to all
# instructors and TAs.
#
# $mail{feedbackRecipients} = ['email@address.here'];



# Users for whom to label problems with the PG file name
# 
# For users in this list, PG will display the source file name when rendering a problem.
# 
# $pg{specialPGEnvironmentVars}{PRINT_FILE_NAMES_FOR} = ['user_id1'];

# The following hashes control which users are allowed to see students from which
# sections.  This is typically  used for large multi-section classes with many students, ta's and
# professors.  When set users will only be allowed to see students from the appropriate section in the following:
# -  Instructor Tools
# -  Student Progress
# -  Email
# -  Problem Grader
# -  Show Answers
# They will be able to see students from other sections on other pages.  
# These variables generally should be set here and not in defaults.conf.

# $viewable_sections = { user_id1 => [1 ,2 ,3] , # list of viewable sections for user_id1
#		       user_id2 => [1],
#		     };

# $viewable_recitations = { user_id1 => [1 ,2 ,3] , # list of viewable recitations for user_id1
#			  user_id2 => [1],
#		     };


# controls if the Tagging features are displayed.  This is mainly used by library editors
# $permissionLevels{modify_tags} = "professor";
