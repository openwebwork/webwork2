# This file is used to override the global WeBWorK course environment for
# requests to this course. All package variables set in this file are added to
# the course environment. If you wish to set a variable here but omit it from
# the course environment,  use the "my" keyword. Commonly changed configuration
# options are noted below.

# Database Layout (global value typically defined in global.conf)
# 
# Several database are defined in the file conf/database.conf and stored in the
# hash %dbLayouts.
# 
# The database layout is always set here, since one should be able to change the
# default value in global.conf without disrupting existing courses.
# 
# global.conf values:
# 	$dbLayoutName = 'sql_single';
# 	*dbLayout = $dbLayouts{$dbLayoutName};

$dbLayoutName = 'sql_single';
*dbLayout = $dbLayouts{$dbLayoutName};

# Global User ID (global value typically defined in database.conf)
# 
# The globalUserID parameter given for the set and problem tables denotes the ID
# of the user that the GlobalTableEmulator will use to store data for the set
# and problem tables.
# 
# If a course will be used under WeBWorK 1.x, this value should be overridden on
# a course-by-course basis to the ID of the professor who is most likely to be
# involved in creating new problem sets. Sets which have not been assigned will
# only be visible to this user when logging into WeBWorK 1.x.
# 
# The global user ID is always set here, since one should be able to change the
# default value in database.conf without disrupting existing courses.
# 
# global.conf values:
# 	$dbLayouts{gdbm}->{set}->{params}->{globalUserID} = 'global_user';
# 	$dbLayouts{gdbm}->{problem}->{params}->{globalUserID} = 'global_user';

$dbLayouts{gdbm}->{set}->{params}->{globalUserID} = 'global_user';
$dbLayouts{gdbm}->{problem}->{params}->{globalUserID} = 'global_user';

# Allowed Mail Recipients (global value typically not defined)
# 
# Defines addresses to which the PG system is allowed to send mail. This should
# probably be set to the addresses of professors of this course. Sending mail
# from the PG system (i.e. questionaires, essay questions) will fail if this is
# not set.
# 
# global.conf values:
# 	$mail{allowedRecipients} = ['gage@math.rochester.edu'];

$mail{allowedRecipients} = ['gage@math.rochester.edu'];

# Feedback Mail Recipients (global value typically not defined)
# 
# Defines recipients for feedback mail. If not defined, mail is sent to all
# instructors and TAs.
# 
# global.conf values:
# 	$mail{feedbackRecipients} = ['gage@math.rochester.edu'];




# Users for whom to label problems with the PG file name (global value typically "professor")
# 
# For users in this list, PG will display the source file name when rendering a problem.
# 
# global.conf values:
# 	$pg{specialPGEnvironmentVars}{PRINT_FILE_NAMES_FOR} = ['gage', 'apizer', 'sh002i', 'professor'];

$pg{specialPGEnvironmentVars}{PRINT_FILE_NAMES_FOR} = ['global_user', 'toenail', 'sam', 'apizer', 'gage'];
