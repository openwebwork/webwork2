# sections.  This is typically used for large multi-section classes with many students, ta's and
# professors.  When set users will only be allowed to see students from the appropriate section in the following:
# - Instructor Tools
# - Student Progress
# - Email
# - Problem Grader
# - Show Answers
# They will be able to see students from other sections on other pages.
# These variables generally should be set here and not in defaults.conf.
