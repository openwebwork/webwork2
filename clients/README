These test clients will process these two commands:

./webwork_xmlrpc_client.pl renderProblem  input.txt >foo.txt
./webwork_xmlrpc_client.pl listLibraries
or

./webwork_soap_client.pl renderProblem  input.txt >foo.txt
./webwork_soap_client.pl listLibraries


You may need to adjust some hardwired parameters in the scripts so that
you are pointed at the correct servers. :-)

The scripts hello_world_xmlrpc.pl and hello_world_soap.pl  take no arguments
and can be used to test the connection with the chosen servers.

The scripts renderProblem.pl and renderProblem_rawoutput.pl are versions of the 
xmlrpc_xmlrp_client which can be used as filters.  The were designed to be used with
bbedit (Mac editor) to send a PG problem file of to a webservice to be rendered.

The rawoutput version decodes the xml response and prints it as perl structures.
The renderProblem.pl pipes the HTML part of the response through safari (other browsers could
be used) for viewing. This is usually what is wanted for testing.  Currently the error recovery
is minimal, so error messages sent from the server may totally confuse the client (which
will probably report a bad result type). The resulting web page is live and pointed
to a responder at webhost.math.rochester.edu.  When that server is working you can
actually submit an answer and have it evaluated.  It's a very old, tired PC running 
Frontier as a server, so be patient with it. :-)

There is  currently much shared code between these scripts.  I'll clean it up 
some day. :-)
