Introduction

   The [1]WeBWorKTeam is pleased to announce the final release of WeBWorK
   2.0. After two years of work, WeBWorK 2 is stable and ready for
   general use. The WeBWorK 1.x series has been end-of-lifed, and we
   recommend that all users upgrade to WeBWorK 2.

   This release includes almost all of the functionality of WeBWorK 1.9,
   and contains new functionality beyond what it possible with 1.9. New
   feature since WeBWorK 1.9 include:

     * An improved database system.
          + Problem sets can be manipulated in the abstract without being
            assigned to students.
          + Sets can be easily assigned and unassigned
          + Problem set defaults are stored once, making it easy to
            change defaults without distubing values overridden for
            particular students.
          + Support for both WeBWorK 1.x databases and SQL databases.
     * A more consistent and easier to use user interface.
          + Breadcrumbs show your current location in the system relative
            to the root.
          + Login message indicates who you are logged in as and who you
            are acting as.
          + Links bar allows quick access to many featuers of the system.
          + Siblings list allows one-click access to other problems in
            the same set or other sets in the same course.
     * Look of pages is fully-customizeable look due to HTML template
       system and CSS support.
     * Global Act As feature allowing instructors to view the system from
       the point of view of a student.
     * Web-based course administration tools.
          + Create and delete courses.
          + Export course databases to standard XML format, import
            exported databases.
     * Architectural improvements make it easy to add features to the
       system.
          + Object-based content generation system enables addition of
            new components easy.
          + Table-driven virtual heirarchy of system components allows
            for customization of system URLs.
          + Modular database layer enables support for additional
            database backends.

   New features since [2]PreviewRelease4 include:

     * New display modes: [3]jsMath and [4]ASCIIMathML (DavideCervone).
     * Support for problem library metadata database (JohnJones).
     * Improved Statistics and Student Progress functionality.
     * Improved Apache configuration and CourseEnvironment seeding.
     * Lockdown of authorization system.
     * Behavior of interactive problem processor customizable.
     * Published flag for problem sets.
     * Hmwk Set Editor updated to match UI of Classlist Editor.
     * User interface improvements.
     * Set Maker improvements (JohnJones).
     * dvipng baseline support for equation images (JohnJones).
     * Automatic upgrading of databases from WeBWorK 1.x courses.
     * Improved sorting of problem sets (WilliamWheeler).
     * Enable upload/download/delete problem files.

Availability

   The complete system is distributed as two tarballs. One for the
   WeBWorK system itself, and one for the PG system, including a standard
   set of PG modules and macro files.

   Files are available below and on our SourceForge project page:
   [5]http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93112

   Installation directly from CVS is also possible. Refer to the
   [6]InstallationManual for more information.

Installation

   Documentation on installing and configuring WeBWorK is available in
   the [7]InstallationManual. Instructions on [8]CourseCreation and
   [9]CourseUpgrade are also available.

Upgrading SQL course databases

   The structure of SQL databases changed slightly with this release. As
   a result, you must modify any SQL course databases that were created
   with an earlier version of WeBWorK 2. Specifically, you must change
   the name of the problem_header field to hardcopy_header. If you are
   using MySQL, you can use the following tiny script:
echo "ALTER TABLE set_not_a_keyword CHANGE COLUMN problem_header hardcopy_heade
r TEXT;" \
"ALTER TABLE set_user CHANGE COLUMN problem_header hardcopy_header TEXT;" |
mysql -u root -p webwork_CourseID

   Replace CourseID with the name of the course you want to modify.

Bug Reports & Feature Requests

   Submit bug reports and feature requests at
   [11]http://bugs.webwork.rochester.edu/. We can't fix bugs and add
   features if you don't tell us about them!

Patches

   While we welcome patches of any sort, by patching against the latest
   CVS code, you save us and yourself time. A bug in this release may be
   fixed in CVS, and we can more easily handle patches against the latest
   code. Check out the latest development version from CVS and patch
   against that. Consult the [12]WeBWorKCVS topic for more information.
