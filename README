Introduction

   This release fixes two bugs in WeBWorK 2.0.

    1. When course databases were upgraded, sets, but not problems, were
       assigned to the global user. This caused sets appear to be empty
       when it was assigned to a user after the upgrade. Bugzilla bugs
       [1]#611 and [2]#614 are related to this issue.
    2. The date calculation routines before() and after(), used to
       compare the current time to the set dates, were not inclusive.

Fixing courses upgraded with WeBWorK 2.0

   To fix corruption of courses upgraded with WeBWorK 2.0:

    1. Log into the course with WeBWorK 1.9 and delete the global user
       (usually called global_user).
    2. Log into the course with WeBWorK 2.0.1. You will be prompted to
       upgrade the database. Do so.
    3. If you had assigned sets to any users with WeBWorK 2.0, unassign
       and reassign the sets to each user.

Bug Reports & Feature Requests

   Submit bug reports and feature requests at
   [7]http://bugs.webwork.rochester.edu/. We can't fix bugs and add
   features if you don't tell us about them!

Patches

   While we welcome patches of any sort, by patching against the latest
   CVS code, you save us and yourself time. A bug in this release may be
   fixed in CVS, and we can more easily handle patches against the latest
   code. Check out the latest development version from CVS and patch
   against that. Consult the [8]WeBWorKCVS topic for more information.
