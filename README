Introduction

   The [7]WeBWorK Team is pleased to announce the release of [8]WeBWorK
   2.0 Preview Release 4. While it is intended primarily for testing,
   development, and evaluation of the new system, it is also suitable for
   use in live courses.

   This release includes almost all of the functionality of WeBWorK 1.9,
   and contains new functionality beyond what it possible with 1.9. New
   features since [9]PreviewRelease3 include:

     * architectural improvements
     * user interface improvements
     * web-based course management
     * new Set Maker feature for interactive set building
       (JohnJones[10]?)
     * many bug fixes

Availability

   The complete system is distributed as two tarballs. One for the
   WeBWorK system itself, and one for the PG system, including a standard
   set of PG modules and macro files.

   Files are available below and on our SourceForge project page:
   [11]http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93112

Bug Reports & Feature Requests

   Submit bug reports and feature requests at
   [23]http://bugs.webwork.rochester.edu/. We can't fix bugs and add
   features if you don't tell us about them!

Patches

   While we welcome patches of any sort, by patching against the latest
   CVS code, you save us and yourself time. A bug in Preview Release 4
   may be fixed in CVS, and we can more easily handle patches against the
   latest code. Check out the latest development version from CVS and
   patch against that. Consult the [24]WeBWorKCVS topic for more
   information.
