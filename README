Introduction

   The [8]WeBWorKTeam is pleased to announce the release of WeBWorK 2.1.
   This release includes new functionality and enhancements to the user
   interface, database system, and PG language:

     * New sql_single database layout, for more efficient access to SQL
       databases.
     * New [9]mathematical-expression parser (for use in writing PG
       problems).
     * New File Manager module provides full access to course files.
       (Will replace File Xfer module in a future release.)
     * New Problem Set Detail module allows editing of set data (dates,
       headers), editing of problems (source file, value, etc.), and
       reordering of problems.
     * Improvements to jsMath display mode.
     * Many usability and cosmetic improvements.
     * Many bugfixes.

   (Contributiors: please feel free to add anything I've forgotten.)

Availability

   WeBWorK 2.1 requires [10]PGLanguageRelease2pt1. Both WeBWorK and PG is
   available on our SourceForge project page:
   [11]http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93112

   Installation directly from CVS is also possible. Refer to the
   [12]InstallationManualV2pt1 for more information.

Installation

   Documentation on installing and configuring WeBWorK is available in
   the [13]InstallationManualV2pt1. If you are upgrading an existing
   installation, be sure to read the section [14]Upgrading an existing
   WeBWorK installation.

  Using the new 'sql_single' database layout

   The new sql_single database layout stores the data for all courses
   using the layout in a single database, reducing the number of
   connections that need to be made to the SQL server and eliminates the
   need for database to be created and deleted as courses are created and
   deleted. It also adds indexing to data tables, improving system speed.

   To learn more about the database options available in WeBWorK 2.1,
   including the sql_single layout, consult the [15]Database
   configuration section of [16]InstallationManualV2pt1 and the
   [17]DatabaseLayoutManual.

   Before creating courses using the sql_single layout (or converting
   existing courses), you must [18]create a single database and grant
   access to it.

   We suggest that you convert all courses using the sql database layout
   to use sql_single instead and add indexing to converted courses.
   Instructions are available in the [19]CourseAdministrationManual.

Help

   If you need help installing or using WeBWorK 2.1, consult
   [20]WeBWorKDocs and [21]WeBWorKFAQs.

   You can also visit the [22]WeBWorK discussion group and post your
   question there. The developers monitor this forum.

Bug Reports & Feature Requests

   Submit bug reports and feature requests at
   [23]http://bugs.webwork.rochester.edu/. We can't fix bugs and add
   features if you don't tell us about them!

Patches

   While we welcome patches of any sort, by patching against the latest
   CVS code, you save us and yourself time. A bug in this release may be
   fixed in CVS, and we can more easily handle patches against the latest
   code. Check out the latest development version from CVS and patch
   against that. Consult the [24]WeBWorKCVS topic for more information.
