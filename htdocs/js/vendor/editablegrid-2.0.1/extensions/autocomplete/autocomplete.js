 * - quit with escape without match (IE/FF: OK)
 * - save with click on suggestion (IE/FF: OK)
 * - save with enter with match (IE/FF: OK)
 * - save with enter without match (IE/FF: OK)
 * - save with enter with match, but very quickly before suggestion appears (IE/FF: OK)
 * - type to have a suggestion then continue to have no match and have the list disappear (IE/FF: OK)
 * - save with blur (click elsewhere) with match (FF: OK/IE: KO)
 * - save with blur (click elsewhere) without match (FF: OK/IE: KO)
