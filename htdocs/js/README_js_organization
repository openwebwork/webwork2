This is the README file for the WeBWorK htdocs/js folder. 

Please follow these guidelines for putting javascript in your webwork pages. 


app:    This directory contain the "new" finished apps for WeBWork. 
  	     Each app should have its own directory.

app-dev: A directory for apps that are being developed.  

lib:	 Common files for the web apps. 
   |_    models:  directory for the models
   |
   |_    views: directory for the views. 


All javascript and css libraries are now being handled by bower (https://github.com/bower/bower).  To run bower read the
instructions on github.  You will only need this if you are adding or changing libraries.  

If a library is needed, add it to bower.json and the desired version.  Then type:

#  bower install

and bower will fetch all of the libraries (and update if you've changed the version #) and store everything in the  "bower_components" directory.  The location of each library in each subdirectory SHOULD stay stable, so you shouldn't need to 
update template or other files.
