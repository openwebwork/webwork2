This is the README file for the WeBWorK htdocs/js folder. 

Please follow these guidelines for javascript used by WeBWorK.

js/app: This directory contain first party WeBWorK javascript.
        Each library/app should have its own directory.
        Eventually the `app` sub-directory will be removed and
        js will directly contain all first party WeBWorK
        javascript.

js/vendor: Old third party javascript libraries not yet migrated to npm.
           Eventually this sub-directory will be removed.

js/legacy: Old first javascript files that eventually will be removed.
           Eventually this sub-directory will be removed.

All third party javascript and css libraries will be installed by npm.
Run `npm install libname` in the htdocs directory to install a new library.
Run `npm install` in the htdocs directory to install existing libraries.
The resulting libraries are install in htdocs/node_modules.
