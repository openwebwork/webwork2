xFunctions (from David Eck at Hobart and William Smith College)
http://math.hws.edu/xFunctions/
Doesn't connect directly to WeBWorK but can be useful for students

==================================================

geogebra (version 3.2.40+)
This applet is updated frequently so you will not to get fresh versions at;

==================================================

SketchGraph, SliderGraph, GummyGraph  -- David Eck
Designed specifically to interact with webwork.  
Source code for these applets is in the webwork2/htdocs/applets/source subdirectory
Uses components from this repository:

=================================================

FlashApplets
=================================================


MutiPointGraph.swf, PointGraph.swf -- flash applets from Doug Ensley (Shippensburg U.)  and Mike Gage (UR)
Designed for webwork.  Based on other mathematics applets illustrated at:
http://www.flashandmath.com/mathlets/index.html
and http://www.flashandmath.com/index.html for tutorials on using flash.
See also http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Simple_example for a description of the actionScript code for this flash applet

=================================================


Canvas Applets  
-- a version of SketchGraph in html5 and javaScript by David Gage
-- the code is in webwork2/js/sketchgraphhtml5b 
-- html5 and javaScript is a relatively new technology but it is likely to become important 
   particularly for mobile devices such as the iPad
-- javaScript and actionScript have become fairly similar

=================================================

The existing applets are still mostly at the proof of concept stage. Find useful
questions to build around them or create your own applets which are more flexible or 
more useful.
