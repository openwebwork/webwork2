<p>&nbsp</p>
<UL>

<LI> Click anyplace on the map to move the cursor to that point.

<p>&nbsp</p>

<LI> Notice the readout at the upper right gives the location of the cursor measured in pixels from the lower left corner of the map.

<p>&nbsp</p>

<LI> You can fine tune the location of the cursor by clicking on the four arrows at the left, right, top, and bottom of the map.  Each click moves the cursor one pixel in the direction indicated by the arrow.

<p>&nbsp</p>

<LI> Use the scale printed at the bottom of the map to determine how to convert distances measured on the map in pixels to distances on the ground measured in miles or kilometers.
