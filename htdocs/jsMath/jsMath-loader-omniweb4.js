/*
 *  jsMath-loader-omniweb4.js
 *  
 *  Part of the jsMath package for mathematics on the web.
 *
 *  This file synchronizes the jsMath-loader.html file with
 *  the actual loading of the source javascript file.
 *  OmniWeb 4 has a serious bug where the loader file is run
 *  several times (and out of sequence), which plays havoc
 *  with the Start() and End() calls.
