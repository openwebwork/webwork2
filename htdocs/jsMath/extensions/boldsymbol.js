/*
 *  extensions/boldsymbol.js
 *  
 *  Part of the jsMath package for mathematics on the web.
 *
 *  This file implements the \boldsymbol macro.  You can activate it
 *  by calling
 *  
 *    jsMath.Extension.Macro('boldsymbol');
 *  
 *  which will cause the extension to be loaded only when it is
 *  needed, or you can force it to be loaded via
 *  
 *    jsMath.Extension.Require('boldsymbol');
 *    
 *  once jsMath.js has been loaded.
 *  
 *  Note that you will need to install the cmmib10 and cmbsy10 fonts
 *  that are available from the jsMath extra font page at
 *  
 *      http://www.math.union.edu/locate/jsMath/download/extra-fonts/
 *
 *  to make this work in image mode.  Note that there is no unicode
 *  fallback for these fonts at the moment.
