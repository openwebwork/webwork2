<body><br>
<p>This page is a useful tool for Professors who want to see how their students are doing. Statistics can either be viewed for a single
set or for a single user simply by clicking on the link.</p>
<p>The "Ind" column is :  (totalNumberOfCorrectProblems / totalNumberOfProblems)^2/ AvgNumberOfAttemptsPerProblem), which is a more 
useful number when it comes to summarizing how well students are doing.</p>
<p>The bottom most chart on the set statistics can be resorted by any column by clicking the blue link of that column's name.</p>
