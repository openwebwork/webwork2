<h3>Instructor Tools Help Page</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
This page allows quick access to an individual student's homework set,
 a homework set for the entire class, or the class roster data for one or more
 students.  
</p>

<p>
It is a collection of short cut techniques which allow you to modify the database with fewer
page clicks than are required when using the "Class List Editor" and "Hmwk Sets Editor" pages. It is often more efficient because the set and the student can both be selected at the same time.
</p>

<p>
New users will probably find it easier to use those two pages until they get used to the information required.
</p>
 
<p>
Importing and exporting class lists, and deleting students <strong>must</strong> be done
from the class list editor.
