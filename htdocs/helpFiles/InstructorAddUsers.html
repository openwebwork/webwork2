<h3>Add User Help Page</h3>
<p>The number of rows can be changed by changing the number in the text box and hitting the "create" button, but be careful, 
once some information is entered do not change the number of rows or all the text in the boxes will be lost.</p>
<p>The only mandatory information is the "login" and the "Student ID", the Student ID will be the student's initial password.</p>
<p> Any other boxes may be left blank, but it may be useful to fill in section and recitation as they can be used to seperate 
scores later on.</p>
<p>Multiple sets may be given to the user by holding down the shift key while selecting from the list.</p>
