<h3>PG Problem Editor Help Page</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
This page allows one to edit the contents of PG problem files (templates)
as well as set headers and other files.
</p>
<p>
When using this page two or more windows may be created -- one to edit the text in the 
file and one to view the results.  This can be a bit confusing.  If a window seems to 
have completely disappeared make sure that it is not hiding behind one of the other windows.

	<dt>		The large text window</dt>
		<dd>		This is where you edit the text of the problem template.  Nothing happens until you pick an action (below) and 
		            click the "Take action!" button.</dd>
		</dl>
		
<h4>Action items:</h4> <i>(If an action cannot be executed it will not appear as an action item.)
</i>
<dl>
	<dt>		View using seed "12345" and display mode "image"</dt>
		<dd>		Will bring up a window to show the results of your editing.  It does not change the permanent file on the disk. You can view
		            different versions of the same problem by changing the seed (any number will do).  You can also change mannerin which the 
		            mathematics is typset (jsMath and images are the most common modes.)</dd>
	<dt>		Add to set ...</dt>
		<dd>		Add this problem as the last problem of an existing set, either as a problem or as the set header 
		           (the text that appears on the home page of a homework set). You can rearrange the order of the problems later using 
		            the "Hmwk Sets Editor"</dd>
	<dt>		Save as [TMPL]/"path"...</dt>
		<dd>		Makes a new copy of the file you are editing at the location relative to the course's templates ([TMPL]) directory given by  "path".
		            The checkbox allows you to replace the current problem with the new problem in the current homework set. 
		            <p> Check the checkbox if you want to edit the current problem without changing the original problem file.</p>
		            <p> Leave the checkbox unchecked if you are using the current problem as a model for a brand new problem. You can add the
		                new file to the homework set from the Library Browser.</p>
		            <p>If the original problem can not be edited than the path name
		            must be changed in order to be allowed to save the problem. (Adding  "local/" to the beginning of the original path is the default solution. All locally created and 
		            edited files will then appear in a subdirectory named "local". </p>
		            <p>A new problem whose path ends in blankProblem.pg should be given a new name, for example, "myNewProblem.pg")</P></dd>
	<dt>		Revert</dt>
		<dd>		Reverts to the copy of the file saved on the disk -- all unsaved editing changes will be lost. 
		            This option only appears when you have making
		            provisional edits using the first option "View..." above</dd>
	<dt>		Take action</dt>
		<dd>		Executes the action item selected above. You can elect to have the results of this action appear in a new window.
