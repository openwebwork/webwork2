<title>OPL Problem Levels</title>
</head>

<body><br>
<p>
Some OPL problems have been rated for difficulty/educational objective.
The levels are loosely inspired by Bloom's taxonomy.  They are assigned
numbers from 1 to 6 as follows.
</p>
<ol>
<li> problems with this rating should only require
direct memory of a fact.  Examples might be a specific value of a function,
or the statement of a definition.  Very few WeBWorK problems fall into
this category.

<li> usually means students must demonstrate
understanding of facts.  This is more than regurgitating the fact.
We use this category for simple and direct applications of algorithms the 
student has studied.  There should be no judgement involved in choosing 
the method.  This would include a simple application of a rule for 
differentiation
(e.g., can combine rules for sums and constant multiples with one more
advanced rule) or for integrals.


<li> we use this for carrying out more complicated 
algorithms, such as derivatives using both the product and chain rule 
or integrals which involve say both a substitution and parts.

<li> these problems require some application of algorithms, 
but do not rise to the level of a full word problem. For example, "Identify 
the local extrema for f(x) = ...".  One has to apply algorithms and interpret
results.

<li> 
word problems

<li> Applying definitions theoretically and proof writing
</ol>
