<ul type="square">

<li><u>Examples of fractions, which are of the form a / b for non-decimal numbers a and b that have no common factors, include:</u>
<blockquote>
<tt>5/2, -1/3, pi/3, 4, sqrt(2)/2</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Examples of fractions that can be simplified include:</u>
<blockquote>
<tt>15/6, (3-4)/3, 2*pi/6, (16/2)/2</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes decimals are not allowed:</u>
<blockquote>
Allowed: &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>5/2, -1/3, pi/3, 4, sqrt(2)/2, 2^(1/2)</tt><br />
Not allowed: &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>2.5, -0.33333, 3.14159/3, 0.707106/2, 2^(0.5)</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes a mixed fraction is required:</u>
<blockquote>Enter <tt>1 2/3</tt> (for 1 and 2/3) with a space between the 1 and the 2 instead of <tt>5/3</tt></blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, you must make an integer into a fraction:</u>
<blockquote>Enter <tt>4/1</tt> instead of <tt>4</tt></blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>If there is more than one correct answer, enter your answers as a comma separated list.</u>
<blockquote>
For example, if your answers are <nobr><tt>-3/2, 4/3, 2pi, e^3, 5</tt></nobr> enter
<nobr><tt>3/2, 4/3, 2*pi, e^3, 5</tt></nobr>
</blockquote>

<li><u>If there are no solutions:</u>
<blockquote>
Enter &nbsp; <tt>NONE</tt> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <tt>DNE</tt> &nbsp; (this may vary from problem to problem)
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, certain operations are not allowed.</u>
<blockquote>Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <tt>+</tt>, subtraction <tt>-</tt>, multiplication <tt>*</tt>, and exponentiation <tt>^</tt> (or <tt>**</tt>).  When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</u>  
<blockquote>Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <tt>sqrt( )</tt>, absolute value <tt>| |</tt> (or <tt>abs( )</tt>), as well as other named functions such as <tt>sin( )</tt>, <tt>ln( )</tt>, etc.  When these functions are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
