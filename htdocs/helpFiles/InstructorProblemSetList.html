		<dd>Indicates the number of problems in the set.  Clicking on this link allows you to edit the set headers,
		change the problem order, specifying the number of allowed attempts and the weight (credit value) of each problem.
		You can also inspect and edit the template of the problem and delete the problem entirely.  
		<p>
		To add new problems use the "Library Browser".
		</dd>
	<dt>"Edit Assigned Sets" column</dt>
		<dd>Shows how many instructors and students have been assigned this problem set, out of the total number in the class. 
		    (While testing it is best to assign
		    the problem only to instructors and TA's; once the set is ready, assign it to the entire class or section.)
		    Clicking on this link allows you to assign or unassign this set to additional users and to individually edit 
		    the assignment to specific users. For changing dates for individual users there are also 
		    shortcuts from the "Instructor Tools" link.
		    </dd>

		    choose "Edit selected" from the tasks above.
