<li><u>Both ^ and ** are used for exponentiation.</u>
<blockquote>For example, <tt>x^2</tt> and <tt>x**2</tt> are the same, as are <tt>e^(-x/2)</tt> and <tt>1/(e**(x/2))</tt></blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Square roots have a named function, but other roots do not and should be entered using fractional exponents.</u>
<blockquote>
For example, the square root of 2 can be entered as <tt>sqrt(2)</tt>, <tt>2^(1/2)</tt>, or <tt>2**(1/2)</tt>, but the cube root of 2 must be entered as <tt>2^(1/3)</tt> or <tt>2**(1/3)</tt>.  The parentheses in <tt>2^(1/3)</tt> are required, since <tt>2^1/3</tt> will be interpreted as <tt>(2^1)/3 = 2/3</tt>.
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, fractional exponents and certain operations are not allowed.</u>
<blockquote>Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <tt>+</tt>, subtraction <tt>-</tt>, multiplication <tt>*</tt>, division <tt>/</tt>.  When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>

<li><u>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</u>  
<blockquote>Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <tt>sqrt( )</tt>, absolute value <tt>| |</tt> (or <tt>abs( )</tt>), as well as other named functions such as <tt>sin( )</tt>, <tt>ln( )</tt>, etc.  When these functions are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
