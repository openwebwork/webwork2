<h3>Sets assigned to student Help Page</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A student must be assigned a homework set in order for it to appear on their WeBWorK home page. Check the box in the left column to assign a student to that homework set. Uncheck the box to unassign a student.  If a student is unassigned from a homework set, all of the student's data for that homework set is deleted 
and cannot be recovered. Use this action cautiously! </p>

<p>
Change the due dates for an individual
student on this page.  Check the checkbox and enter the new date in order
to override the date. (You can copy the date format from the date in the right hand column which indicates the date when the homework set is due for the whole class.)
</p>

<p>
Click on the homework set links to edit change the grades for this individual student on the homework set. (The grade of each problem is called the "status".)
You can also change the number of allowed attempts and further modify the 
individual student's homework set.) You will also be able to change a student's seed which determines the individual values used in the individual version of the student's problem and the weight (how much a problem counts towards the grade.)
