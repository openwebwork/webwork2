<ul type="square">

<li><u>Examples of (real) numbers include:</u>
<blockquote><tt>4, 5/2, -1/3, pi/3, e^3, 3.1415926535, sqrt(2) = 2^(1/2), ln(2), sin(2pi/3)</tt></blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>If there is more than one correct answer, enter your answers as a comma separated list.</u>
<blockquote>
For example, enter &nbsp; <nobr><tt>-1.5, 4/3, 2pi, e^3, 5</tt></nobr><br />
Do not use commas in large numbers: enter &nbsp; <tt>4321</tt> &nbsp; (not &nbsp; <tt>4,321</tt>)
</blockquote>

<li><u>If there are no solutions:</u>
<blockquote>
Enter &nbsp; <tt>NONE</tt> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <tt>DNE</tt> &nbsp; (this may vary from problem to problem)
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>If your answer is a decimal, give at least 5 decimal places.</u>
<blockquote>Typically, if your answer is correct to 5 decimal places it will be marked correct, although the number of decimal places required may vary from problem to problem.  When in doubt, give more decimal places.</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, fractions and certain operations are not allowed.</u>
<blockquote>Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <tt>+</tt>, subtraction <tt>-</tt>, multiplication <tt>*</tt>, division <tt>/</tt>, and exponentiation <tt>^</tt> (or <tt>**</tt>).  When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</u>  
<blockquote>Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <tt>sqrt( )</tt>, absolute value <tt>| |</tt> (or <tt>abs( )</tt>), as well as other named functions such as <tt>sin( )</tt>, <tt>ln( )</tt>, etc.  When these functions are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
