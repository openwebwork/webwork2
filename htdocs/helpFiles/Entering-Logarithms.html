<li><u>Entering natural logarithms:</u> &nbsp; <tt>ln(x)</tt> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <tt>log(x)</tt>
<blockquote>
The default is that &nbsp; <tt>ln(x)</tt> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <tt>log(x)</tt> &nbsp; are <b>both</b> the natural log function.  (Although unlikely, your professor may have changed the default setting for your course.)
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Entering base 10 logarithms:</u> &nbsp; <tt>log10(x)</tt> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <tt>logten(x)</tt>
<blockquote>
The default is that &nbsp; <tt>log10(x)</tt> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <tt>logten(x)</tt> &nbsp; are <b>both</b> the base 10 logarithm function.  (Although unlikely, your professor may have changed the default setting for your course.)
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Entering logarithms base b:</u>  &nbsp; <tt>ln(x)/ln(b)</tt> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <tt>log10(x)/log10(b)</tt>
<blockquote>
WeBWorK does not recognize logarithms to other bases, so you must use the change of base formula for logarithms to enter your answer.  For example, enter log base 2 of x as 
<br /><br />
<tt>ln(x)/ln(2)</tt> &nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>log10(x)/log10(2)</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Put parentheses around the arguments to logs:</u>
<blockquote>
<tt>ln(2x+8)</tt> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <tt>ln2x+8 = ln(2)*x+8</tt> &nbsp; are very different.
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes logarithms must be simplified or expanded:</u>
<blockquote>
For example, the required answer may be &nbsp; <tt>ln(6) + ln(x)</tt> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <tt>ln(6x)</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, certain operations are not allowed.</u>
<blockquote>Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <tt>+</tt>, subtraction <tt>-</tt>, multiplication <tt>*</tt>, division <tt>/</tt>, and exponentiation <tt>^</tt> (or <tt>**</tt>).  When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</u>  
<blockquote>Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <tt>sqrt( )</tt>, absolute value <tt>| |</tt> (or <tt>abs( )</tt>), as well as other named functions such as <tt>sin( )</tt>, <tt>ln( )</tt>, etc.  When these functions are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
