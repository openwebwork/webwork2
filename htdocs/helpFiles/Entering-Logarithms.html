<li><font color='#222255'>Entering natural logarithm:</font> In this question, use <code>ln(x)</code> or <code>log(x)</code>.
<br /><br /></li>
<li><font color='#222255'>Entering base 10 logarithm:</font> In this question, use <code>log10(x)</code> or <code>logten(x)</code>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><font color='#222255'>Entering logarithms base b:</font>  &nbsp; <code>ln(x)/ln(b)</code> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <code>log(x)/log(b)</code><blockquote>WeBWorK does not recognize logarithms to other bases, so you must use the change of base formula for logarithms to enter your answer.  For example, enter log base 2 of x as <br /><br /><code>ln(x)/ln(2)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp; <code>log(x)/log(2)</code></blockquote></li>
<li><font color='#222255'>Put parentheses around the arguments to logs:</font><blockquote><code>ln(2x+8)</code> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <code>ln2x+8 = ln(2)*x+8</code> &nbsp; are very different.</blockquote></li>
<li><font color='#222255'>Sometimes logarithms must be simplified or expanded:</font><blockquote>For example, the required answer may be &nbsp; <code>ln(6) + ln(x)</code> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <code>ln(6x)</code></blockquote></li>
<li><font color='#222255'>Sometimes, certain operations are not allowed.</font><blockquote>Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <code>+</code>, subtraction <code>-</code>, multiplication <code>*</code>, division <code>/</code>, and exponentiation <code>^</code> (or <code>**</code>).  When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote></li>
<li><font color='#222255'>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</font>  <blockquote>Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <code>sqrt( )</code>, absolute value <code>| |</code> (or <code>abs( )</code>), as well as other named functions such as <code>sin( )</code>, <code>ln( )</code>, etc.  When these functions are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote></li>
