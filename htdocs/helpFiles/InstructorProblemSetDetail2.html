<h2>Set Detail 2 Help Page</h2>

<!--
<h3> Quick Links </h3>

<ul>
   <li> I do <i>foo</i> and nothing seems to happen! </li>
   <li> My problems are in random order </li>
   <li> My nose is leaking. </li>
   <li> How does this work? </li>
</ul>
-->
<h3> "Modes" </h3>

<p>The <strong>Set Detail</strong> page can be viewed in one of two distinct modes:
	<ul>
		<li> All students </li>
		<li> One specific student </li>
	</ul>

This should be quite clear at the top of the page.  

<h3> Contents </h3>

<ul type="1">
	<li> <a href="#form">Form buttons</a>
	<li> <a href="#general">General Information</a>
	<li> <a href="#headers">Headers</a>
	<li> <a href="#problems">Problems</a>
</ul>




<h4> <a name="form">Form buttons</a> </h4>
<dl>
	<dt> Save Changes </dt>
		<dd>Occurs twice on the page, at the top and the bottom.  <br>Any and all changes made to any
		part of the set will be saved with one important exception: When editing the set for one
		or more students, you can choose to override the default value (defined for the set in 
		general) by clicking on the checkbox and providing a value (or possibly leaving a blank).
		If you do <strong>NOT</strong> check the checkbox, the override value will be discarded.
		<p><small>Example:</small>
		<br><input type="checkbox"> Weight <input value=2 size=5> 1
		<br><input type="checkbox" checked> Weight <input value=2 size=5> 1
		<br><small>The first value of 2 will be discarded because the checkbox is not checked.</small>
		</dd>
	<dt> Reset Form </dt>
		<dd>Discards any and all changes, reloading the page by re-reading the database information
		for this set.  Also, resets the display modes.<p></dd>
	<dt> Display Mode </dt>
		<dd>You can maintain a different display mode for the problems if you want.
	<dt>Add blank problem template</dt>
		<dd> Adds a new, essentially blank, problem to the homework set when the homework set is saved.  
		You can modify this to create your own problem, by clicking on the "Edit it" link and 
		saving the "blankProblem.pg" to some new file, e.g. "myNewProblem.pg".
</dl>

<h4> <a name="general">General Information</a> </h4>
<dl>
<dt>Reordering Problems</dt>
<dd>
You can reorder problems by clicking on the arrow icon and dragging the problem.  You will see a box showing you where the problem will be placed.  When problems are reordered any holes in the numbering will be filled in. </dd>

<dt>Deleting Problems</dt>
<dd> You can delete problems by clicking the "Delete it?" check box and saving.  If the set is already active it is recommended that you instead use the "Mark Correct?" problem to mark a particular problem correct for all students.</dd>

<dt>Viewing Problems</dt>
<dd>
You can view a problem by clicking the render icon underneath the problem number.  The Display Mode used to render the problem is chosen using the drop down menu.  You can render all problems using the Render All button. Hide All will hide all of the problems.  
</dd>

<dt>Problem Paths</dt>
<dd>
All of the paths for problem files are relative to the templates directory
of the current course.  You can access this directory "directly" using the File Manager
page.
