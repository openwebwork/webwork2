<p>
WeBWorK does not have a full featured scoring ability -- we leave that to your
favorite spread sheet application.  
</p>

<p>
What WeBWorK does have is good support for summarizing the scores on WeBWorK
homework sets and exporting them in a form (.csv) which any spreadsheet can use.
WeBWorK reports all of the homework grades,
creates a column which totals these grades and leaves it at that.
</p>

<p>
Click on the sets you want scored (usually all of them :-) ) 
choose the name of the export file you want to 
use (by default:  courseName_totals.csv) and then click the
"score selected sets" button.
</p>

<p>
If you want a form that is easy to read on the web (for a quick look at grades)
click the "pad fields" option.  This adds spaces the fields which makes the 
columns easy to read when in text form but it can confuse
some spread sheet applications since the extra spaces violate the csv standard
(although Excel handles them with no problem). If you want a reliable .csv file
for use in any spreadsheet application unclick the "pad fields" option.
You can download the .csv file immediately by clicking on the link, or you
can download it using the "File Manager" from the scoring directory.
</p>

<p>
I have no clue what "record scores for single sets" does -- sorry.
</p>

<p>
The index is a number assigned on the basis of the number of incorrect attempts
(roughly equivalent to 1/the number of attempts) which seems to correlate with
the relative difficulty the student had with the problem.
</p>

<p>
We would all like to be able to merge the spreadsheet with the webwork grades
and a spread sheet with the excel grades automatically.  Unfortunately this 
application has not yet been written for WeBWorK and for that matter it doesn't
appear to be an ability that Excel has either.  The closes I have been able
to find is third party software for excel (e.g. http://www.synkronizer.com/e/tutorial_merging.html)
</p>

<p>
To use the Email and spreadsheet merge feature, upload your spreadsheet with
calculated grades to the scoring directory using the File Manager link. 
</p>

<p>
Do NOT use the file name courseName_totals.csv, since you might accidentally 
overwrite that if you again export your WeBWorK homework scores (actually the 
earlier file is moved to courseName_totals_bak1.csv -- so you can recover 
using the File Manager -- but it's still a pain).
</p>

<p>
If you upload your file on the web with the name: <code>report_grades_data.csv</code>
and also create an email message with the name <code>report_grade.msg</code> with the 
approriate <code>$COL</code> variables then not only can you email the message
with the embedded grades to the students, but files with those exact names are 
automatically appended to the "Grades" page seen by the students.
