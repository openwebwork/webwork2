	<dt>Sort</dt>
		<dd>Sorts the lists displayed; by due date, name, etc.</dd>
	<dt>Edit</dt>
		<dd>The sets checked below will become available for editing the due dates and set headers.</dd>
	<dt>Make visible/hidden</dt>
		<dd>The sets checked below will be visible to students or hidden from students.  Useful for preparing sets
		    ahead of time, but not showing them to students; or for temporarily hiding a set which has a mistake in 
		    it while it is being fixed.</dd>
	<dt>Import</dt>
		<dd>Import a set from a set definition file. 
		    (Use "File Transfer" to upload/download set definition files.)</dd>
	<dt>Export</dt>
		<dd>The sets checked below will written to set definition files, to be saved for future use, or 
		    to be transferred to another course.  The set definition files can be uploaded/downloaded 
		    using "File Transfer".
		    </dd>
	<dt>Score</dt>
		<dd>Student scores for the sets selected below will be calculated.  This and other scoring operations
		    can also be done using the "Scoring Tools" link. </dd>

<hr>
Other actions
<dl>
	<dt>"Problems" column</dt>
		<dd>Indicates the number of problems in the set.  Clicking on this link allows you to edit the set headers,
		change the problem order, specifying the number of allowed attempts and the weight (credit value) of each problem.
		You can also inspect and edit the template of the problem and delete the problem entirely.  
		<p>
		To add new problems use the "Library Browser".
		</dd>
	<dt>"Assigned Users" column</dt>
		<dd>Shows how many instructors and students have been assigned this problem set, out of the total number in the class. 
		    (While testing it is best to assign
		    the problem only to instructors and TA's; once the set is ready, assign it to the entire class or section.)
		    Clicking on this link allows you to assign or unassign this set to additional users and to individually edit 
		    the assignment to specific users. For changing dates for individual users there are 
		    shortcuts from the "Instructor Tools" link.
		    </dd>
	<dt>Remaining columns</dt>
		<dd>These columns, including dates for problem sets can be edited by clicking the pencil, next to the set name,
		    or by clicking the check box and 
		    choosing "Edit" from the tasks above.  The second method allows you to edit more than one set at once; 
		     useful if you have to change the dates
		    of several problem sets at the same time.
		    <p>
		    The headers have moved -- to edit them click in the "problems" column.
