<ul type="square">

<li><u>Limits whose values are numbers:</u>
<blockquote>
For example, lim<sub>x &rarr; &infin;</sub> arctan(x) = &pi;/2, so you would enter &nbsp; <tt>pi/2</tt> 
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Limits whose values are infinite:</u>
<blockquote>
Enter &nbsp; <tt>infinity</tt>, &nbsp; <tt>inf</tt>, &nbsp; <tt>-infinity</tt>, &nbsp; <tt>-inf</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Limits that don't exist:</u>
<blockquote>
Enter &nbsp; <tt>DNE</tt> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <tt>NONE</tt> &nbsp; (this may vary from question to question)
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Limits whose value is a function:</u>
<blockquote>
Enter the function using appropriate syntax, for example:<br />
<tt>sqrt(x) = x^(1/2)</tt>, <tt>abs(x) = | x |</tt><br />
<tt>2^x, e^x, ln(x), log10(x)</tt> <br />
<tt>sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), csc(x), sec(x), cot(x)</tt><br />
<tt>arcsin(x) = asin(x) = sin^(-1)(x)</tt><br /> 
<tt>arccos(x) = acos(x) = cos^(-1)(x)</tt><br />
<tt>arctan(x) = atan(x) = tan^(-1)(x)</tt><br />
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes answers must be simplified:</u>
<blockquote>
For example, &nbsp; <tt>6x+5-2x+7</tt> &nbsp; should be simplified to &nbsp; <tt>4x+12</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, certain operations are not allowed.</u>
<blockquote>Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <tt>+</tt>, subtraction <tt>-</tt>, multiplication <tt>*</tt>, division <tt>/</tt>, and exponentiation <tt>^</tt> (or <tt>**</tt>).  When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
</li>

<li><u>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</u>  
<blockquote>Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <tt>sqrt( )</tt>, absolute value <tt>| |</tt> (or <tt>abs( )</tt>), as well as other named functions such as <tt>sin( )</tt>, <tt>ln( )</tt>, etc.  When these functions are not allowed, it is usually because you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.</blockquote>
