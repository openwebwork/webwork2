<p>If you want to see the problems change the display mode and press "Refresh". The order of problems can be changed by changing the
numbers. After a problem is deleted (by checking delete and then the "Save Problem Changes" button on the bottom of the page) 
the number is left empty unless the option above the button is checked. The
weight of a problem is how many points will be awarded for it during scoring.</p>
