Using Interval Notation
</h4>

<ul>

<li> If an endpoint is included, then use <tt>[</tt> or <tt>]</tt>.  If not, then use <tt>(</tt> or <tt>)</tt>.  For example, the interval from
-3 to 7 that includes 7 but not -3 is expressed <tt>(-3,7]</tt>.

<br>
<br>

<li> For infinite intervals, use <tt>Inf</tt> for <font size="+2">&#8734;</font> (infinity) and/or 
<tt>-Inf</tt> for <font size="+2">-&#8734;</font> (-Infinity).  For example, the infinite interval containing all points greater than 
or equal to 6 is expressed <tt>[6,Inf)</tt>.

<br>
<br>

<li> If the set includes more than one interval, they are joined using the union
symbol U.  For example, the set consisting of all points in (-3,7] together with all points in [-8,-5) is expressed <code>[-8,-5)U(-3,7]</code>.

<br>
<br>

<li> WeBWorK will not interpret <tt>[2,4]U[3,5]</tt> as equivalent to <tt>[2,5]</tt>.  
All sets should be expressed in their simplest interval notation form, with no 
overlapping intervals.

</ul>
