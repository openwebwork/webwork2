<p>The "Ind" column is :  (totalNumberOfCorrectProblems / totalNumberOfProblems)^2/ AvgNumberOfAttemptsPerProblem), which is a more 
useful number when it comes to summarizing how well you are doing.
</p>
<p>In the problems section of the chart the upper letter represents whether or not the problem was answered correctly (C for 
correct) and the lower number is the number of times the problem was attempted.</p>
