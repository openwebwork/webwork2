This is an "alternative" colorization to math4.  If you want to provide 
multiple themes to your users you should follow this as an example.  

Everything (except the override files) should be a link pointing back to 
math4.  This will make it so that all your themes will automatically get 
updates.  All of your changes should be in the override files.
