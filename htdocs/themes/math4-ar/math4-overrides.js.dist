/* This is the override file for math4.js.  If you copy 
 * math4-overrides.js.dist to math4-overrides.js you can edit the
 * values contained in this file and they will override the css values 
 * normally used for math4.  This includes anything you can accomplish with
 * jQuery and provides a lot of flexibility.  
 *
 * If you upgrade your machine this file will not be overwritten, however, the 
 * math4.js and math4-overrides.js.dist file may change.  If this happens it
 * may cause problems with your theme until your reconcile the changes with 
 * your modifactions here.  (Similar to how localOverrides.conf works.)
