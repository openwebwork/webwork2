Use the prelocal.conf and postlocal.conf files to make modifications.  

The prelocal.conf file is read before the global.conf.dist file is processed. Non-local variables in this file
are then available for use in global.conf.dist.

The postlocal.conf file is read after the global.conf.dist file is processed and will overright configurations in global.conf.dist

This new  configuration system should greatly simplify the process of 
updating webwork2 since it is less likely
that one will need to modify the config files when upgrading.  Default configurations or permissions for 
new features will be defined in global.conf.dist and will allow automatic upgrades.  

Overrides for these new features can be added later to postlocal.conf

FIRST TIME RECONFIGURATION

COPY prelocal.conf.dist to prelocal.conf.
COPY postlocal.conf.dist to postlocal.conf.

MODIFY prelocal.conf using the data from your global.conf file.  
In particular you will need to fill in the server name, the 
password for the database and any modifications you have made as to the 
location of the temporary files directory. Notice that the location of the temporary files directory
is used to define several other related subdirectories, so this modification needs to be made
in prelocal.conf BEFORE the standard global.conf.dist file is read.

RENAME global.conf to global.save in order to make sure that the global.conf.dist is read.
Otherwise the global.conf file will be read instead of global.conf.dist and the behavior will be
as with the old system.

INSPECT and possibly modify postlocal.conf to add any further local modifications that you had
made to your global.conf file.
