# then you will need to use what you have that variable set to instead. Be
# careful since the default value of $webworkDirs{tmp} depends on the value of
# $webworkDirs{root} (which is /opt/webwork/webwork2 by default). So if you
# customize $webworkDirs{root}, then you will need to adjust the path
# accordingly. Also, change www-data:www-data in the command to be
# server_user:server_group where server_user and server_group are the values of
# those settings above. The post hook in the command will run every time that
# certificates are automatically renewed, and will fix permissions on the new
# certificates so that the webwork2 app can read them, and will hot reload the
# webwork2 app to load the new certificates (with zero downtime).

  # Documentation about the settings being provided below can be found at
  # https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojo/Server/Hypnotoad#SETTINGS

  # WeBWorK is essentially all blocking code, so allowing hypnotoad to allow
  # a worker to accept additional requests when a request is being processed
  # can cause severe latency/delays when a new request is waiting for a "slow"
  # request to be completed. Thus, in accordance with the recommendations for
  # such settings, for example in https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo/wiki/Benchmarking
  # set clients to 1, and set workers to a larger number.

  # Critical tuning for a production server is to increase workers based on the
  # system resources available (primarily RAM) and the expected concurrent load.
  #    workers is the number of hypnotoad processing which are created and
  #            run at all times to be available to server requests.
  #    spare is the number of additional workers which can be started as
  #            replacements for workers which have been signaled to stop
  #            themselves (gracefully) in order to be replaced by a new worker.
  # Since spare allows additional workers to be started before old ones have
  # stopped, the value of workers+spare needs to take into account the
  # available memory of the system.
  #
  # The majority of RAM available for workers should probably be dedicated to
  # making workers as high as possible, to allow connections from many end
  # users to be accepted and processed in parallel. However, due to the extensive
  # amount of time (heartbeat_timeout+graceful_timeout) a worker can remain busy
  # before being forcefully killed, reserving some RAM to allow a moderate value
  # of spare is recommended.
  #
  # We recommend setting spare to at least 5 on a server with under 8GB of RAM,
  # and at least 8-10 on a server with over 8GB of RAM. As possible, consider
  # increasing spare to about 10% of the value of workers on your server, should that
  # be larger than the setting suggested above.
  #
  # Recommendations for tuning of workers and spare based on RAM available:
  #    Consider using 10-12 workers and one spare for each GB of RAM
  #    (after setting aside 2-4 GB of RAM for the OS and all other software needed).
  # On a machine with less than 8GB of RAM, decrease workers and raise spare to make
  # sure that spare is at least 5.
  # These are provisional recommendations based on some testing, but without
  # experience with the Mojolicious webwork system in a production environment.
  #
  # It is recommended to monitor memory usage under load to determine what further
  # tuning of the settings may be appropriate.

  clients: 1
  workers: 25
  spare: 8

  # WeBWorK apparently has some memory leaks which lead to workers using up more memory
  # over time as additional requests are processed.
  # Requests which process many problem renders in a single call will
  # trigger faster accumulation of "lost memory". The "accepts" parameter
  # should be kept relatively low to avoid the "lost memory" from causing
  # significant problems.
  accepts: 100

  # Keep-alive related settings. These limit how long an inactive connection
  # (one with no active request) can remain open, and how many requests (ex.
  # for additional files) can be sent over the same connection.
  # In order to prevent a worker from being kept waiting for additional requests
  # from a browser which in not active, keep_alive_timeout is set relatively low,
  # but an attempt is made to allow a bit of time before connections will be
  # closed, to reduce the need for a new connection to be opened if a user
  # is actively navigating on the site.
  # To allow all dependencies of a WeBWorK page to be served over a single
  # connection the value of requests was set to 50.
  keep_alive_timeout: 15
  requests: 50

  # The graceful_timeout determines how long hypnotoad will wait before hard
  # killing a worker which was marked as failing to send heartbeats due to
  # failing or having "blocked" while doing a very slow operation.
  # After the graceful_timeout passes, the worker will be killed and whatever
  # it was doing will get stopped without completing. Potentially, this could
  # cause inconsistencies in the database or other less than ideal outcomes.
  # Try to set to provide enough spare time to avoid such problems!
  graceful_timeout: 120

  # The following timeout settings will be sufficient in most cases.  However, if you have large class sizes they may
  # not be enough.  If you are seeing long requests fail then increase these.  This may happen, for example, if you have
  # a class with thousands of users and try to assign a set to all users.  In that case you may need much larger values.
  # Note that if you are serving via a proxy, you may also need to increase the timeouts for the proxy server.

  heartbeat_timeout: 60
