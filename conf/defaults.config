# Session Management
################################################################################

## Session management, i.e., checking whether the session has timed out,
## can be handled either using the key database, the traditional method,
## or by using session cookies.  If one is using the key database
## for session_management and is using WeBWorK's password authentication,
## then one has the option of keeping a Login cookie with a duration
## of up to 30 days.  However, if one uses cookies for session management,
## then one cannot also use Login cookies.  So session managment using
## cookies is more appropriate when external authentication systems
## are used, e.g., LDAP, LTIBasic, etc.
##

## The following ability to update the cookie timestamp instead of the timestamp in the database
## has been disabled for now.  It opens a potential security hole. 
## Setting $session_management_via="session_cookies" sets a session cookie automatically
## even if you don't ask for it explicitly and this login cookie contains a session_key which
## allows you to reenter your course (within 20 minutes or so) even if you move away from the 
## webwork HTML page and loose the session_key embedded in the HTML page.
## However the time stamp in the cookie is not used currently used for anything.
## 
#### NOT CURRENT:  The reason one might want to use cookies for session management
#### is to avoid having to obtain a write lock on the Key database
#### every time a request is received in order to update the timestamp
#### in the Key database.  When cookies are used for session management,
#### one obtains a write lock on the Key database for the original
#### login request in order to write the new session key and its initial
#### timestamp to the Key database, but on subsequent requests,
#### one merely obtains a read lock on the Key database in order
#### to verify that the session key in the session cookie is the
#### same as the session key in the Key database.  The session timestamp
#### is maintained in the cookie, not in the Key database, which will
#### only show the timestamp of the original login.



## For session management using session_cookies, uncomment the first of the 
## following lines.  
## For session management using keys stored
## in the  key  database and, possibly, enduring cookies if any have been set,
## uncomment the second line.

## These choices can be overridden locally in the localOverrides.conf file.
## The default is to use "session_cookie".
