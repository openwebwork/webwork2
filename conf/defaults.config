# session cookie with a duration determined by the $CookieLifeTime setting below
# by checking the "Remember Me" checkbox on the login page.

# Setting $session_management_via="session_cookies" uses a session cookie to
# manage the session. Note that even in this case a key is stored in the
# database which is compared to the key stored in the session cookie.

# Note that the key database method is less secure as the key must be embeded in
