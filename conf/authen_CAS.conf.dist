# Set CAS as the authentication module to use.

$authen{cas_options} = {
	# Options to pass to the AuthCAS module.
	# Note that this is (plain) AuthCAS, not Apache::AuthCAS
	# or Apache2::AuthCAS.
	# You need at least casUrl and CAFile; others can be set as well.
	AuthCAS_opts => {
		# URL of CAS server.  Edit the host below.
		casUrl => '', #e.g. 'https://auth.berkeley.edu/cas',

	},

	# Options specific to CAS authentication in WeBWorK

	# On most college campuses, the CAS system is a campus-wide system,
	# and individual departments may not be able to create their own CAS
	# userids.  Instead, therefore, we support a "setUser" facility, with
	# controls over which users can use it and (optionally) which users
	# they can switch to.

	# This is controlled by a hash, in which the keys are the users allowed
	# to use the setUser function, and the values are either a string
	# (optionally ending in '*', signifying pattern matching) or an array
	# of such strings.
	#
	# Examples:
	#
	#   sudoers => undef,		# turns off this feature completely
	#
	#   sudoers => {admin => '*',
	#   		alice => ['demo*', 'yxzzy'],
	#   		bob => ['test1', 'test2'],
	#   		},
	#
	# This option can also be set in a course.conf file (after this file
	# authen_CAS.conf has been read in).
	#
	# Although it is true that users who can use this feature must be
	# mentioned explicitly in the sudoers hash, they do not have to have
	# accounts in the course in which it is being used.  Therefore, except
	# for people who administer the webwork site as a whole, it is best
	# to put such settings in the relevant course.conf files.
	#
	# Examples in course.conf file:
	#
	#   $authen{cas_options}{sudoers} = {
	#     'profgauss' => ['teststudent', 'testta'],
	#     };
	#
	#   # Add to existing hash
	#   $authen{cas_options}{sudoers}{profwiles} = 'test*';
	#
	# Sample usage:  To log in as user "bob" in course Calc101, access
	# webwork using a url such as:
	#	https://webwork.ouruniversity.edu/webwork2/Calc101/?setUser=bob

	sudoers => undef,
};
