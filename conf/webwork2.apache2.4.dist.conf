# Uncomment the following lines to allow access to show-source.cgi.  This allows the "show source" button that is added
# by the "source.pl" macro to work for demonstration "courses".  It requires that a show-source.cgi script be customized
# and placed in the courses html directory.  You will also need to enable the apache2 cgi module with `sudo a2enmod cgi`
# for this to work.  Note that if you have the mpm_event module enabled instead of mpm_worker, then you will need the
# cgid module instead.  Apache2 will automatically select this module if the given command is used.  The "show source"
# button is most useful for webwork "courses" used to train new authors.  It is not desirable to expose the code of
# regular homework questions to students.
