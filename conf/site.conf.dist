# This file is used to set up the default WeBWorK course environment for all
# requests. Values may be overwritten by the course.conf for a specific course.
# All package variables set in this file are added to the course environment.
# If you wish to set a variable here but omit it from the course environment,
# use the "my" keyword. The $webwork_dir variable is set by the webwork2
# Mojolicious app and is available for use here. In addition, the $courseName
# variable holds the name of the current course.

# This file is used to set up the basic paths and URLs specific to your
# installation of WeBWorK, with the exception of the $webwork_dir variable which
# is set by the webwork2 Mojolicious app.  Any customization of global WeBWorK
# settings should be done in localOverrides.conf.
