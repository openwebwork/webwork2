# This script wraps system-dependant calls to several netpbm utilities.
# In order to use this script, set the NETPBM variable below to the
# directory which contains giftopnm, ppmtopgm, and pnmtops.

NETPBM=/usr/local/bin

# If you wish to set the paths to each utility separately, i.e. if they
# are in different locations, do so below:

PNGTOPNM=$NETPBM/pngtopnm;
PPMTOPGM=$NETPBM/ppmtopgm;
PNMTOPS=$NETPBM/pnmtops;

# There should be no need for customization beyond this point.

umask 022
cat $1 | $PNGTOPNM | $PPMTOPGM | $PNMTOPS -noturn 2>/dev/null > $2

# CODER NOTE:
# We used to use `pnmdepth 1' instead of ppmtopgm as it creates a
# monochrome image (1 bit) rather than a greyscale image (8 bits).
# However, this was causing improper display of some sort in PDFs.
