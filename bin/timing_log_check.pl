# This script reads the timing log and outputs timing information including
# the number and per cent of accesses taking various amount of time.
# It can give you a rough idea of how well your server id performing.
# If you have a large timing log, it can tale awhile for the script to complete processing.

# To run the script, cd to the WeBWorK logs directory (usually /opt/webwork/webwork2/logs)
# and enter the command: timing_log_check.pl 

# Note that this assumes perl is locates in /usr/bin/perl (check with the command "which perl")
# and /opt/webwork/webwork2/bin/ is in your path.
