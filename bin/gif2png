# This script wraps system-dependant calls to several netpbm utilities.
# In order to use this script, set the NETPBM variable below to the
# directory which contains giftopnm, ppmtopgm, and pnmtops.

NETPBM=/usr/local/bin

# If you wish to set the paths to each utility separately, i.e. if they
# are in different locations, do so below:

GIFTOPNM=$NETPBM/giftopnm;
PNMTOPNG=$NETPBM/pnmtopng;

# There should be no need for customization beyond this point.
