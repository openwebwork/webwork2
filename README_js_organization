This is the README file for the WeBWorK htdocs/js folder. 

Please follow these guidelines for putting javascript in your webwork pages. 


app:    This directory contain the "new" finished apps for WeBWork. 
  	     Each app should have its own directory.

vendor:  This is the directory for all 3rd party javascript files. 
         If it is a single file, then it should just go in the vendor directory
         All bundles should go in a directory (i.e. Jquery and plugins.)
