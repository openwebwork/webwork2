# didn't add it.  If you're feeling industrious...

#FIXME?  I originally changed   join("\0",....)  to join(\0, ....) since I'm pretty sure that what was desired
# was a string separated by nulls.   If one of the items in the list began with a number  eg 14
# you would get    \014....\0name...\0   etc.  I think \0name evaluates properly but I'm pretty
# sure that \014 does not.
#
# Then I backed out of the change until this gets checked more thoroughly by Sam
# -- Mike
