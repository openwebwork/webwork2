						. 'only be added to the DIV enclosing the problem if it is different than the value which '
						. 'should be set in the main HTML tag set for the entire course based on the course language.'
						. '</p><p>There are two options for the DIRection attribute: "ltr" for left-to-write scripts, '
						. 'and "rtl" for right-to-left scripts like Arabic and Hebrew.</p><p>The DIRection attribute '
						. 'is needed to trigger proper display of the question text when the problem text-direction '
						. 'is different than that used by the current language of the course. For example, English '
						. 'problems from the library browser would display improperly in RTL mode for a Hebrew course, '
						. 'unless the problen Direction is set to LTR.</p><p>The feature to set a problem language and '
						. 'direction was only added in 2018 to the PG language, so most problems will not declare '
						. 'their language, and the system needs to fall back to determining the language and direction '
						. 'in a different manner. The OPL itself is all English, so the system wide fallback is to '
						. 'en-US in LTR mode.</p><p>Since the defaults fall back to the LTR direction, most sites '
						. 'should be fine with the "auto::" mode, but may want to select the one which matches their '
						. 'course language. The mode "force::ltr" would also be an option for a course which runs into '
						. 'trouble with the "auto" modes.</p><p>Modes:</p><ul><li>"none" prevents any additional LANG '
						. 'and/or DIR tag being added. The browser will use the main setting which was applied to the '
						. 'entire HTML page. This is likely to cause trouble when a problem of the other direction is '
						. 'displayed.</li><li>"auto::" allows the system to make the settings based on the language '
						. 'and direction reported by the problem (a new feature, so not set in almost all existing '
						. 'problems) and falling back to the expected default of en-US in LTR mode. </li>'
						. '<li>"auto:LangCode:Dir" allows the system to make the settings based on the language and '
						. 'direction reported by the problem (a new feature, so not set in almost all existing '
						. 'problems) but falling back to the language with the given LangCode and the direction Dir '
						. 'when problem settings are not available from PG.</li><li>"auto::Dir" for problems without '
						. 'PG settings, this will use the default en=english language, but force the direction to '
						. 'Dir. Problems with PG settings will get those settings.</li><li>"auto:LangCode:" for '
						. 'problems without PG settings, this will use the default LTR direction, but will set the '
						. 'language to LangCode.Problems with PG settings will get those settings.</li>'
						. '<li>"force:LangCode:Dir" will <b>ignore</b> any setting made by the PG code of the problem, '
						. 'and will force the system to set the language with the given LangCode and the direction to '
