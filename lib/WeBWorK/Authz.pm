package WeBWorK::Authz;

=head1 NAME

WeBWorK::Authz - check user permissions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # create new authorizer -- $r is a WeBWorK::Request object.
 my $authz = new WeBWorK::Authz($r);
 
 # tell authorizer to cache permission level of user spammy.
 $authz->setCachedUser("spammy");
 
 # this call will use the cached data.
 if ($authz->hasPermissions("spammy", "eat_breakfast")) {
 	eat_breakfast();
 }
 
 # this call will not use the cached data, and will cause a database lookup.
 if ($authz->hasPermissions("hammy", "go_to_bed")) {
 	go_to_bed();
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WeBWorK::Authen determines if a user is authorized to perform a specific
activity, based on the user's PermissionLevel record in the WeBWorK database and
the contents of the %permissionLevels hash in the course environment.

=head2 Format of the %permissionLevels hash

%permissionLevels maps text strings describing activities to numeric permission
levels. The definitive list of activities is contained in the default version of
%permissionLevels, in the file F<conf/defaults.config>.

A user is able to engage in an activity if their permission level is greater
than or equal to the level associated with the activity. If the level associated
with an activity is undefiend, then no user is permitted to perform the
activity, regardless of their permission level.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over

=item WeBWorK::Authz->new($r)

Creates a new authorizer instance. $r is a WeBWorK::Request object. It must
already have its C<ce> and C<db> fields set.

=cut

sub new {
	my ($invocant, $r) = @_;

	};

	bless $self, $class;

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item setCachedUser($userID)

Caches the PermissionLevel of the user $userID in an existing authorizer. If a
user's PermissionLevel is cached, it will be used whenever hasPermissions() is
called on the same user. Only one user can be cached at a time. This is used by
WeBWorK to cache the "real" user.

=cut

sub setCachedUser {
	my ($self, $userID) = @_;

		warn "setCachedUser() called with userID undefined.";
	}
}

=item hasPermissions($userID, $activity)

Checks the %permissionLevels hash in the course environment to determine if the
user $userID has permission to engage in the activity $activity. If the user's
permission level is greater than or equal to the level associated with $activty,
a true value is returned. Otherwise, a false value is returned.

If $userID has been cached using the setCachedUser() call, the cached data is
used. Otherwise, the user's PermissionLevel is looked up in the WeBWorK
database.

If the user does not have a PermissionLevel record, the permission level record
is empty, or the activity does not appear in %permissionLevels, hasPermissions()
assumes that the user does not have permission.
