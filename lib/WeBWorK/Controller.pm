# Mojolicious already keeps a cache of parameter values and also allows setting of parameters.  So everything done here

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $c->ce([$new])

Return the course environment (WeBWorK::CourseEnvironment) associated with this
request. If $new is specified, set the course environment to $new before
returning the value.  In this case the value of $new is also saved to the stash
as 'ce'.  This means that this value is available as $ce in the templates.

=cut

sub ce ($c, $new = undef) {
	$c->stash->{ce} = $c->{ce} = $new if defined $new;
	return $c->stash->{ce};
}

=item $c->db([$new])

Return the database (WeBWorK::DB) associated with this request. If $new is
specified, set the database to $new before returning the value.  In this case
the value of $new is also saved to the stash as 'db'.  This means that this is
available as $db in the templates.

=cut

sub db ($c, $new = undef) {
	$c->stash->{db} = $c->{db} = $new if defined $new;
	return $c->stash->{db};
}

=item $c->authen([$new])

Return the authenticator (WeBWorK::Authen) associated with this request. If $new
is specified, set the authenticator to $new before returning the value.  In this
case the value of $new is also saved to the stash as 'authen'.  This means that
this value is available as $authen in the templates.

=cut

sub authen ($c, $new = undef) {
	$c->stash->{authen} = $c->{authen} = $new if defined $new;
	return $c->stash->{authen};
}

=item $c->authz([$new])

Return the authorizer (WeBWorK::Authz) associated with this request. If $new is
specified, set the authorizer to $new before returning the value.  In this case
the value of $new is also saved to the stash as 'authz'.  This means that this
value is available as $authz in the templates.

=cut

sub authz ($c, $new = undef) {
	$c->stash->{authz} = $c->{authz} = $new if defined $new;
	return $c->stash->{authz};
}

=item $c->submitTime([$new])

Return the time this request was received for processing, which we refer
to as the submitTime. The time is recorded very early on in the processing
of the request. If $new is specified, set submitTime to $new before returning
the value.

=cut

sub submitTime ($c, $new = undef) {
	$c->stash->{submitTime} = $c->{submitTime} = $new if defined $new;
	return $c->stash->{submitTime};
}

sub language_handle ($c, $new = undef) {
	$c->stash->{language_handle} = $c->{language_handle} = $new if defined $new;
	return $c->stash->{language_handle};
}

=head1 ERROR OUTPUT FUNCTIONS

associated warnings.
