"<p>Mode in which the LANG and DIR settings for a single problem are "

"value determined from the problem, a course-wide default, or the system "
"default, depending on the mode selected. The tag will only be added to the "
"DIV enclosing the problem if it is different than the value which should be "
"set in the main HTML tag set for the entire course based on the course "
"language.</p><p>There are two options for the DIRection attribute: \"ltr\" "
"for left-to-write scripts, and \"rtl\" for right-to-left scripts like Arabic"
" and Hebrew.</p><p>The DIRection attribute is needed to trigger proper "
"display of the question text when the problem text-direction is different "
"than that used by the current language of the course. For example, English "
"problems from the library browser would display improperly in RTL mode for a"
" Hebrew course, unless the problen Direction is set to LTR.</p><p>The "
"feature to set a problem language and direction was only added in 2018 to "
"the PG language, so most problems will not declare their language, and the "
"system needs to fall back to determining the language and direction in a "
"different manner. The OPL itself is all English, so the system wide fallback"
" is to en-US in LTR mode.</p><p>Since the defaults fall back to the LTR "
"direction, most sites should be fine with the \"auto::\" mode, but may want "
"to select the one which matches their course language. The mode "
"\"force::ltr\" would also be an option for a course which runs into trouble "
"with the \"auto\" modes.</p><p>Modes:</p><ul><li>\"none\" prevents any "
"additional LANG and/or DIR tag being added. The browser will use the main "
"setting which was applied to the entire HTML page. This is likely to cause "
"trouble when a problem of the other direction is "
"displayed.</li><li>\"auto::\" allows the system to make the settings based "
"on the language and direction reported by the problem (a new feature, so not"
" set in almost all existing problems) and falling back to the expected "
"default of en-US in LTR mode. </li><li>\"auto:LangCode:Dir\" allows the "
"system to make the settings based on the language and direction reported by "
"the problem (a new feature, so not set in almost all existing problems) but "
"falling back to the language with the given LangCode and the direction Dir "
"when problem settings are not available from PG.</li><li>\"auto::Dir\" for "
"problems without PG settings, this will use the default en=english language,"
" but force the direction to Dir. Problems with PG settings will get those "
"settings.</li><li>\"auto:LangCode:\" for problems without PG settings, this "
"will use the default LTR direction, but will set the language to "
"LangCode.Problems with PG settings will get those "
"settings.</li><li>\"force:LangCode:Dir\" will <b>ignore</b> any setting made"
" by the PG code of the problem, and will force the system to set the "
"language with the given LangCode and the direction to Dir for <b>all</b> "
"problems.</li><li>\"force::Dir\" will <b>ignore</b> any setting made by the "
