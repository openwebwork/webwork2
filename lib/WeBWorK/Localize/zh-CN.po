"tag being added. The browser will use the main setting which was applied to "
"the entire HTML page. This is likely to cause trouble when a problem of the "
"other direction is displayed.</li><li>\"auto::\" allows the system to make "
"the settings based on the language and direction reported by the problem (a "
"new feature, so not set in almost all existing problems) and falling back to"
" the expected default of en-US in LTR mode. </li><li>\"auto:LangCode:Dir\" "
"allows the system to make the settings based on the language and direction "
"reported by the problem (a new feature, so not set in almost all existing "
"problems) but falling back to the language with the given LangCode and the "
"direction Dir when problem settings are not available from "
"PG.</li><li>\"auto::Dir\" for problems without PG settings, this will use "
"the default en=english language, but force the direction to Dir. Problems "
"with PG settings will get those settings.</li><li>\"auto:LangCode:\" for "
"problems without PG settings, this will use the default LTR direction, but "
